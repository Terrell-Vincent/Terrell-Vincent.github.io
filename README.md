-The interface will have the users personalized calendar, news feed, clock, and weather that will constantly be updated everytime the program is ran.  
-The interface will also have health-related information such as sleeping information, information about weight that is constantly being updated, and how long the mirror has been in use.
  
**B Requirements**   
**Common uses**   
	-Clicking the floor number to go to that floor    
	-Clicking the button to close the doors manually or keep them open    
**Rare uses**   
	-The emergency call button   
  
-The interface makes these common things very easy to use. Every button has a label that makes it very easy to understand exactly what will happen if that button is pressed. This even has braille on the labels to help visually impared users be able to use their elevator with little to no problem.    
-The usual course of events is once the user has entered the elevator they observe the panel in order to select which floor they wish to be taken to. Once they have seen which floor they wish to be taken to they then press the button that corresponds with that floor. Once the button is pressed they wait for the doors to automatically close or if they are in a rush they will click the button that closes the doors manually.    
-The elevator supports the user by having labels next to each button so that it is easy to understand what will happen if that button is pressed.    
-The elevator will provide feedback by having the button that the user has chosen light up indicating that that button was correctly pressed. It will also close the doors after a certain amount of time after the button is pressed indicating that the elevator is about to take you to that floor.    
-A mistake you could make is clicking the wrong button and there isn't an efficient way to remove that selection, so the elevator will go to that floor regardless.    
-You can add a button that will remove the selection from the interface so if a button is accidentally pressed you wonâ€™t be forced to go to that floor.

I added an undo button so that for example if you have a child with you and they click multiple floors that you are not trying to go to. With this button you'll be able to avoid having to go to each floor that was pressed.
