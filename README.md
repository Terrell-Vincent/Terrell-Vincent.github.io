Touch screen elevator interface  
First time using this software so can I edit this and it work?
  
C Requirements  
 One issue with the interface is the buttons to close and open the doors could be confusing for first time users. They can appear to just be arrows pointing randomly either away or to a line in the middle, which can lead to users not knowing what they do. Also the bell and phone icons don't give clear instructions on what they are meant to be used for.  
  
B Requirements  
 Common uses  
  Clicking the floor number to go to that floor  
  Clicking the button to close the doors manually or keep them open
