Touch screen elevator interface
First time using this software

C Requirements
One issue with the interface is the buttons to close and open the doors could be confusing for first time users. They can appear to just be arrows pointing randomly either away or to a line in the middle, which can lead to users not knowing what they do. Also the bell and phone icons don't give clear instructions on what they are meant to be used for.
Overall this is a good design. The numbers are in numerical order even though the first floor button doesn't have a number, but that is most likely due to the number rubbing off over time. The buttons will light up depending on which button you pressed in order for the interface to give the user feedback which is very useful.  

B Requirements
Common uses
Clicking the floor number to go to that floor
Clicking the button to close the doors manually or keep them open
Rare uses
The emergency call button
The interface makes these common things very easy to use. Every button has a label that makes it very easy to understand exactly what will happen if that button is pressed. This even has braille on the labels to help visually impared users be able to use their elevator with little to no problem.
The usual course of events is once the user has entered the elevator they observe the panel in order to select which floor they wish to be taken to. Once they have seen which floor they wish to be taken to they then press the button that corresponds with that floor. Once the button is pressed they wait for the doors to automatically close or if they are in a rush they will click the button that closes the doors manually.
The elevator supports the user by having labels next to each button so that it is easy to understand what will happen if that button is pressed.
The elevator will provide feedback by having the button that the user has chosen light up indicating that that button was correctly pressed. It will also close the doors after a certain amount of time after the button is pressed indicating that the elevator is about to take you to that floor.
A mistake you could make is clicking the wrong button and there isn't an efficient way to remove that selection, so the elevator will go to that floor regardless.
You can add a button that will remove the selection from the interface so if a button is accidentally pressed you wonâ€™ft be forced to go to that floor.
